# marioJStutorial
 Decide to do something fun first Javascript project. so searched Youtube and found one on building a Mario game using the kaboom.js library. The tutorial teaches you the set-up and the creation of two levels. On my blog ( https://munchbyte.tech/ ) there is a write up of how I follwed the tutorial.
 
 As a follow up to this Iam creating a game called BEENZ using and expanding on what this teaches me.
